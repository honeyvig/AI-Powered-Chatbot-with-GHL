====================
To create a Python code structure for developing an AI-powered chatbot tailored for your agency, you can break down the project into several components. Below is a sample Python code framework for building and deploying a chatbot that integrates with the Go High Level platform, handling client inquiries effectively, and improving the overall customer experience.
Key Components of the Chatbot:

    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use OpenAI's GPT model or another NLP framework to handle client queries.
    Go High Level Integration: Use the Go High Level API to connect the chatbot with your system.
    Dialog Management: Maintain context and flow in conversations.
    Frontend (Optional): Integrate the chatbot into a user interface (e.g., on your website or in-app chat).
    Testing & Troubleshooting: Continuously test and troubleshoot the chatbot for accurate and efficient responses.

Python Code Structure for AI Chatbot
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

pip install openai requests flask

Step 2: Define Functions to Set Up and Interact with the Chatbot

import openai
import requests
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# Set up the OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

# Go High Level API details (ensure you have access to their API)
GO_HIGH_LEVEL_API_URL = "https://api.gohighlevel.com/v1"
GO_HIGH_LEVEL_API_KEY = "your_gohighlevel_api_key"

# Initialize Flask app (for integration with a web interface)
app = Flask(__name__)

# Function to interact with OpenAI's GPT model to get a chatbot response
def get_chatbot_response(user_input):
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",  # Use the appropriate engine
            prompt=f"Human: {user_input}\nBot:",  # Format the conversation prompt
            max_tokens=150,
            temperature=0.7,
        )
        return response.choices[0].text.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

# Function to handle Go High Level API requests (example: to fetch client details)
def fetch_client_data(client_id):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {GO_HIGH_LEVEL_API_KEY}"
    }
    response = requests.get(f"{GO_HIGH_LEVEL_API_URL}/contacts/{client_id}", headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": "Failed to fetch client data"}

# Route for the chatbot endpoint (integration with web chat UI)
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
    user_input = request.json.get("user_input")
    client_id = request.json.get("client_id")

    # Fetch client data from Go High Level (optional)
    client_data = fetch_client_data(client_id)

    # Get the chatbot response using the OpenAI model
    chatbot_response = get_chatbot_response(user_input)

    # Return the chatbot's response, along with any relevant client data if necessary
    return jsonify({
        "response": chatbot_response,
        "client_data": client_data
    })

# Start the Flask server (to handle real-time conversations)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Key Components Breakdown:

    OpenAI GPT Integration:
        The get_chatbot_response() function uses OpenAI's GPT to generate a response based on the user's input.
        The conversation is formatted as a simple back-and-forth exchange: "Human: {user_input}\nBot:".

    Go High Level API Integration:
        The fetch_client_data() function connects to the Go High Level API, using the provided API key to fetch client data (for example, client contact details).
        This can be expanded to fetch any necessary client-specific information, enabling personalized interactions.

    Flask Web App:
        The Flask web server is used to handle incoming POST requests for chatbot interactions. This is helpful if you want to integrate the chatbot into a web-based chat interface (e.g., on your agency's website).
        The chat() route receives user input and an optional client_id to fetch data from Go High Level. It then returns the chatbot's response and any relevant client data.

Deployment:

    Frontend: You can use this Flask app in combination with a frontend chat widget (e.g., a simple JavaScript chat UI) to allow clients to interact with the chatbot on your website or within your system.
    Webhook Integration: If your platform or website supports webhooks, you can set up a webhook to call the /chat route when a client sends a message to the bot.
    Real-Time Communication: To make the chatbot interactive, integrate it into a live chat UI using WebSockets or similar real-time communication protocols.

Additional Features for the Chatbot:

    Personalization: The chatbot can use the data retrieved from Go High Level to personalize the conversation with users based on their past interactions or account details.

    User Authentication: For a more secure setup, you can integrate authentication (e.g., OAuth) to ensure that only authorized users interact with the chatbot and access personalized data.

    Advanced Features: You can expand the bot’s functionality by adding more complex features, like:
        Multilingual support.
        Integrations with other APIs to provide more specific information (e.g., services, pricing).
        Advanced analytics to track user interactions and optimize responses.

    Error Handling & Troubleshooting: Ensure you handle errors gracefully, both for user input and integration with Go High Level, to ensure smooth user experiences.

Final Notes:

    Testing and Iteration: The chatbot should undergo continuous testing to ensure it answers client queries effectively. Regular feedback from your product and marketing teams will help improve its functionality.
    User Experience: Focus on creating an intuitive and responsive chatbot. If necessary, iterate on the conversation flows based on feedback.
    Security: Make sure to implement proper security practices when dealing with sensitive client data from Go High Level.

By using this framework, you’ll be able to create a powerful, AI-driven chatbot that integrates seamlessly with your existing systems, enhancing client engagement and providing high-quality support.
